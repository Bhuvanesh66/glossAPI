ΠΡΟΛΟΓΟΣ

Ένα από τα πάγια αιτήματα των μαθητών των ΤΕΕ είναι η συγγραφή ενός εγχειριδίου, 
το οποίο αφενός θα είναι επικεντρωμένο αποκλειστικά στις δικές τους ανάγκες όσον 
αφορά  στην  εκμάθηση  της  Αγγλικής,  θα  είναι  ενδιαφέρον,  αισθητικά  ελκυστικό 
και, γενικά, φιλικό προς το χρήστη και αφετέρου θα παραχωρείται δωρεάν από την 
Πολιτεία.

Ασχολούμαστε  με  τη  διδασκαλία  της  Αγγλικής  στα  ΤΕΕ  περισσότερο  από  10  έτη 
προσπαθώντας  να  διερευνήσουμε  τους  παράγοντες  που  επηρεάζουν  τη  μάθηση  και 
την  εκδήλωση  ενδιαφέροντος  των  μαθητών  για  το  μάθημα  της  Αγγλικής.  Πρόσφατα 
(2002-2003), πραγματοποιήσαμε δύο έρευνες στα ΤΕΕ Λιβαδειάς και Σχηματαρίου, με 
θέμα τις προσδοκίες των μαθητών από το μάθημα της Αγγλικής και τα θέματα που θα 
επιθυμούσαν να πραγματεύονται τα βιβλία τους. Οι απαντήσεις τους κατηύθυναν την 
επιλογή των θεματικών ενοτήτων των Γενικά Αγγλικά 1 και Γενικά Αγγλικά 2, καθώς 
επίσης και των δραστηριοτήτων που συνοδεύουν τα κείμενα και τους διαλόγους.

Η χρήση της Αγγλικής παράλληλα με την Ελληνική σε δημόσιους χώρους με τη μορφή 
ανακοινώσεων, οδηγιών κ.λπ. είναι πλέον επιβεβλημένη ανάγκη για την εξυπηρέτηση 
ενός  κοινού  που  δεν  αποτελείται  μόνο  από  Έλληνες.  Την  ανάγκη,  λοιπόν,  να 
διευκολυνθεί η εκμάθηση της Αγγλικής, σήμερα περισσότερο παρά ποτέ άλλοτε κατά 
τη διάρκεια της φοίτησης στο δημόσιο σχολείο, στοχεύει να καλύψει η σειρά Γενικά 
Αγγλικά 1 και 2. Ο Έλληνας πολίτης του μέλλοντος πρέπει να αποδεχτεί το γεγονός 
ότι στην καθημερινή του επικοινωνία θα χρειαστεί να μετατραπεί σε διαμεσολαβητή-
διευκολυντή  στον  εθνικό  του  χώρο  χρησιμοποιώντας  την  Αγγλική  ως  εργαλείο  του. 
Η διείσδυση της γλώσσας αυτής στην κοινωνία της πληροφορικής, στα μέσα μαζικής 
ενημέρωσης,  στο  διαδίκτυο,  στη  διασκέδαση  και στο μάρκετινγκ είναι υπαρκτή, και 
όχι εικονική, πραγματικότητα. Όσο γρηγορότερα, λοιπόν, την κατακτήσει ο μαθητής, 
τόσο  αποτελεσματικότερα  θα  λειτουργήσει  ως  κοσμοπολίτης  του  αύριο  σε  ένα 
πολυπολιτισμικό πλαίσιο σε καθημερινή σχεδόν βάση πια.

Πέρα, όμως, από τη χρήση και επικέντρωση στην εκμάθηση της Αγγλικής, καθίσταται 
αναγκαία, μέσα από το γνωστικό αντικείμενο, όχι μόνο η απόκτηση καθαρά γλωσσικών 
δεξιοτήτων, αλλά και η ανάπτυξη συμπεριφορών, στάσεων και στρατηγικών αναγνώρισης 
της ετερότητας πολιτισμών διαφορετικών από εκείνους των γηγενών πολιτών. Το ελληνικό 
σχολείο σήμερα έχει πολύ ευρύτερους προσανατολισμούς από το σχολείο του χθες. Η 
ύπαρξη αλλόφωνων πληθυσμών στον ελληνικό χώρο και η διάσταση της παγκοσμιότητας 
που επεκτείνει τα ελληνικά σύνορα συνεπάγονται ανοίγματα προς ευρύτερους ορίζοντες 
που κάθε γνωστικό αντικείμενο του σχολείου οφείλει να μην αγνοεί.

Λαμβάνοντας  υπόψη  τα  παραπάνω,  επιλέξαμε  τα  ανάλογα  κείμενα,  διαλόγους, 
λεζάντες,  πόστερ,  διαφημίσεις  και  αποσπάσματα,  έτσι  ώστε  οι  πληροφορίες  που 
δίνονται  από  αυτά  να  είναι  αντικειμενικές,  να  επιτρέπουν  την  ταύτιση,  αλλά  και 
συγχρόνως να δίνουν εναύσματα για σχολιασμό και παρουσίαση και άλλης άποψης. 
Το  διδακτικό  υλικό  συντάχθηκε  με  γνώμονα  το  γνωστικό  επίπεδο  των  μαθητών  των 
ΤΕΕ,  αφού  πρώτα  συμβουλευτήκαμε  ποικίλες  πηγές  σχετικές  με  την  κάθε  θεματική

ενότητα που παρουσιάζουμε, κατά το πλείστον στην Αγγλική, χωρίς να αφήσουμε στο 
περιθώριο και τη χρήση της Ελληνικής.

Οι δραστηριότητες που συνοδεύουν το υλικό στοχεύουν στη σταδιακή προσέγγιση του 
θέματος, ξεκινώντας από το γενικό στο ειδικό, για να προχωρήσουμε στα επόμενα στάδια 
στη γλωσσική ανάλυση της πραγμάτωσης της επικοινωνίας που γίνεται με τη βοήθεια της 
αλληλεπίδρασης και του πιο ελάχιστου μορίου έννοιας με τις γραμματικοσυντακτικές 
και φωνολογικές δομές (How language holds together and works). Επειδή η κατάκτηση 
του  λεξιλογίου  είναι  πάρα  πολύ  βασική  για  την  επικοινωνία  σε  μια  ξένη  γλώσσα  - 
πέρα από τις δραστηριότητες κατανόησης, ανταπόκρισης σε ακουστικά μηνύματα και 
παραγωγής προφορικού και γραπτού λόγου - αφιερώσαμε μια ολόκληρη υποενότητα 
στο παιχνίδι με τις λέξεις (Work and play with words), με τις οποίες είναι αμφίβολο αν, 
υπό άλλες συνθήκες, ασχολούνταν ξανά οι μαθητές ή αν τις έγραφαν απλώς σε ένα 
τετράδιο. Η τελική υποενότητα Make your point είναι η ενότητα όπου ο μαθητής μπορεί 
πια  να  δοκιμάσει  να  παράγει  το  δικό  του  μήνυμα  στην  Αγγλική,  χωρίς  να  εστιάζει 
τόσο  στην  απόλυτα  σωστή  χρήση  της  όσο  στην  επίτευξη  του  επικοινωνιακού  του 
στόχου. Σ’ αυτή την υποενότητα ο μαθητής μπορεί, αν θέλει, να ασχοληθεί με σχέδια 
εργασίας (projects), μόνος του ή σε συνεργασία με τους συμμαθητές του και με τους 
διδάσκοντες των άλλων γνωστικών αντικειμένων, καθώς και με την ευρύτερη σχολική 
ή/και εξωσχολική κοινότητα. Στην υποενότητα Mark your progress, που ακολουθεί μετά 
από την 4η και 9η ενότητα, ο μαθητής μπορεί να αξιολογήσει μόνος του τον εαυτό του, 
να δει ποιες ασκήσεις τον δυσκόλεψαν, πού χρειάζεται να προσπαθήσει περισσότερο 
και τι χρειάζεται να επαναλάβει. Η υποενότητα Stop and do revision που ακολουθεί 
μετά από κάθε τέσσερις ενότητες εστιάζει στον ίδιο ακριβώς σκοπό: να βοηθήσει το 
μαθητή να επαναλάβει την ύλη και να σταθμίσει το πόσο έχει κατακτήσει την Αγγλική 
μέχρι το σημείο του βιβλίου στο οποίο βρίσκεται.

Επειδή  η  μέθοδος  εργασίας  που  προτείνεται  στο  εγχειρίδιο  είναι,  κυρίως,  η 
ομαδοσυνεργατική  και  μαθητοκεντρική,  θα  είναι  προτιμότερο  οι  μαθητές  να 
συζητήσουν  με  το  διδάσκοντα  τους  γενικούς  στόχους  και  σκοπούς  κάθε  κεφαλαίου 
προτού προχωρήσουν στην επεξεργασία του υλικού. Έτσι θα αποκτήσουν μια πρώτη 
εικόνα του τι θα μάθουν και ποιους επικοινωνιακούς στόχους θα μπορούν να επιτύχουν 
σε κάθε ενότητα. Οι λεπτομερείς αυτές πληροφορίες βρίσκονται στο τμήμα Table of 
Contents που προηγείται του Προλόγου.

Αφήνουμε  την  πραγμάτωση  των  στόχων  και  των  επιμέρους  σκοπών  του  βιβλίου  στα 
χέρια των διδασκόντων και των μαθητών. Πιστεύουμε ότι το βιβλίο ΓΕΝΙΚΑ ΑΓΓΛΙΚΑ 
μπορεί να βοηθήσει το μαθητή να κατακτήσει την Αγγλική γλώσσα και να συντελέσει 
στην  ανάπτυξη  της  προσωπικότητάς  του,  ώστε  μαθαίνοντας  πώς  να  μαθαίνει,  να 
αυτονομηθεί και να συνεχίσει αδέσμευτα τη δική του πορεία στο δικό του αύριο, το 
οποίο θα συνοδεύεται από τη χρήση της Αγγλικής σε παγκόσμιο επίπεδο.

 BACK TO SCHOOL 

A. Welcome to Cycle 1, Grade A of TEE

Task 1
Look at the two pictures. What do they show? Discuss in class.

Task 2
Read the information on Greek education below and answer the questions that follow.

School Life News Supplement

Athens, 2004

•  They can attend a Technical Vocational 

Options. Education Today.
by Sonia Pappa

Although people can go on learning while 
they are physically able to do so, compulsory 
education ends when school students reach a 
certain age. This is the picture of what happens 
in Greece today. The information comes from 
Laws 1566/1985 and 2640/1998 which relate to 
Education. Effort has been made to make it 
simple for everybody to understand.

***************
Once High School students finish Junior High 
School*, which usually happens at the age of 
15, the Law offers them three options:
•  They can stop compulsory education 

altogether.

•  They can continue their compulsory 

education and attend Senior High School*.

School (TEE).*

***************

Students who continue their education may 
transfer from one type of school (e.g. Senior 
High School) to another (e.g. TEE), if they 
change their mind later on. This is done only 
under certain conditions.

***************
In High School, Greek students get a general 
type of education. Almost every town has a 
Senior High School. Technical Vocational 
Schools specialise in various sciences and 
technical subjects. Only cities and big towns 
have TEE. Also, not every TEE covers all 
sciences and specialisations. It is, therefore, 
probable that the choice of a TEE, on the 
part of Junior High School leavers, may mean 
moving from the area they live in to specialise 
in what they want.

*Note:  Junior High School = Gymnasium 

Senior High School = Lyceum 
Technical Vocational School = TEE

Task 2
Read the two texts that come from a TEE newsletter with the above photos in mind. 
Are the texts and the photos related to each other?

Text 1
This is the first day of the school year at a Greek TEE. As you know, Technical 
Vocational  Schools  (TEE)  are  schools  that  specialise  in  technical  subjects.  They 
offer training in 14 professional areas of knowledge, while Cycles A and B offer a 
choice of about 80 specialisations.

The snapshots we show you come from TEE Schimatariou, which is a typical school 
of this kind. They could come, however, from any Greek TEE. You could be one of 
the schoolboys and schoolgirls, they could be one of you. At the moment, a group 
of them are in the playground where the A grades, Cycle 1 meet each other for the 
first time, while most of the B grades and C grades (Cycle 2) already know each 
other.

Text 2
What do people do when they meet each other?
First of all, they are happy to see each other again, meet the newcomers and spend 
as much time as they can in the playground. They are joyful and talkative. They 
want  to  know  who  the  others  are,  what  they  share,  how  they  can  get  along  well 
and how they can progress in knowledge about the world around them and about 
themselves.  They  hope  that  their  teachers  and  their  school  as  a  whole  can  help 
them to do this.

Task 3
Read the texts again and write a paragraph about your expectations and feelings when 
you return to school in September, i.e. how you feel when you meet people of your age 
there and what going to school means to you. You can start as follows if you wish.

Task 2
Read  the  text  and  compare  your  answers  to  what  is  said  in  it.  Then  turn  to  your 
partner and have a short talk together about school marks and progress in school.

When most Greek parents receive bad school reports for their children, it seems that 
they are affected much more negatively than their children. “You are not able to attend 
Senior  High  School,  so  you’d  better  go  to  a  Technical  Vocational  School  (TEE)”  is 
a usual reaction to a Junior High School leaver whose school report is not especially 
good. They tend to view a TEE as a kind of school for failures and not a school that may 
perhaps suit the child’s skills and abilities better.

How can one show parents that, if a school report recommends that the child cannot 
progress in that type of school, they’d better make peace with the fact that:
a) it is the school in question that may not be suitable for their child, and
b) a society does not need only doctors and lawyers, but also good technicians of all kinds. 
How can one tell parents that they must understand the possible effect on their child if 
she or he is not ready for a certain type of school, but advances anyway? According to a 
psychologist, “If the learning load in school is too heavy for the child, struggling won’t 
build character, it will erode self-esteem”.

Once parents have reconciled themselves to the fact that their child may not be able to 
achieve much next year in what has been traditionally considered a prestigious type of 
school, what could they do to make choice of a TEE school successful for the child?

Task 3
Read the text again and choose the correct answer.

1. When Greek parents receive bad school reports for their children,

a) they accept the fact that their child may not be good in everything.
b) they feel unhappier than the child and say nasty words.
c) they have a calm talk with the child to see what went wrong.

2. Greek parents seem to view TEE as a school option appropriate for

a) pupils with excellent marks.
b) pupils with skills suitable for this kind of school.
c) pupils with bad marks.

3. What society needs is

a) people of all professions.
b) only doctors and lawyers.
c) only good technicians of all kinds.

4. According to a psychologist, if children go to a school that demands

a) more than they can do, their self-esteem will grow.
b) less than they can do, their self-esteem will grow.
c) more than they can do, their self-esteem will become less.

yourself the following questions. Be honest. Turn to your partner and see how he/she 
has answered his/her questions.

D. How language holds together and works

In this part of Unit 1, you will practise Grammar (how words relate to each other) 
and Syntax (in what order we put words next to each other) in order to be able to 
communicate. In this unit you will also practise English sounds (pronunciation).

``I am going to ...’’ (Future)

In the end of the dialogue on page 6 Nick says that he is going to 
work on his uncle’s farm, and that’s why he chose a TEE. There 
is a strong possibility that his intentions and plans may become 
true. This is how Nick’s family and friends talk about the family’s 
decision.

Read  the  conversation  between  Miss  Stratou,  the  teacher,  and  her  TEE  class  and 
learn more about Hydra.

Teacher:  Harry, why is Hydra quiet?
Harry:   Because there isn’t much traffic there, and there aren’t any industries.
Teacher:  You could be right. Gina?
Gina:   There can’t be much traffic. Hydra is very small.
George:    I’m not sure, but Hydra has no other town or village, apart from the main port. 

The rest of the island is dry and all rocks.

Teacher:   You almost got the answer. No vehicles are allowed on the island. The only means 
of transport are mules and donkeys. You can use your feet, of course, if you like!
I don’t like walking up steep roads.
It’s very unusual for a place not to have any vehicles at all.

Nick:  
Harry:  
Teacher:   You’re  right  Harry,  but  this  makes  Hydra  special.  What  about  its  history? 

Does anybody know anything about Hydra’s history?
.........

 All I know is that Hydra was important in the Greek War of Independence in 1821.

Class:  
Teacher:  Come on, say something.
Elena:  
Teacher:  Bravo, Elena!
Class:   Wow!
Teacher:   Well, the silent group at the back of the class will bring some information on 
Hydra’s history from the library. Their history teacher can help them. They can 
also look at tourist guides on travelling in Greece.

Project are True (T) or False (F).

Our Hydra Project
by Stelios, Martha, Aspasia, Sotiris, Lakis

Hydra is one of the islands of the Argosaronic Gulf, a small distance from the port of 
Piraeus. It is said that once Hydra was covered with forests. The name, Hydra, means a 
place with plenty of water, but today it is grey and rocky.

Since agriculture was impossible, the island could not offer much to make a living. 
As  a  result,  the  people  who  first  settled  on  the  island  started  building  ships.  For  the 
same reason, when the Turks captured Hydra in 1715, they ignored this infertile island. 
The canny Hydriots then built up an important fleet of ships, which developed into a 
merchant marine power. By the 19th century Hydra was rich, a great maritime power 
and had been allowed to acquire autonomous status. Its ships had the monopoly of food 
supplies in the Mediterranean Sea.

Hydriots were not the first to start the Greek War of Independence against the Turks 
in 1821. When they joined, however, their ships made up two-thirds of the whole Greek 
fleet. More than that, Hydra offered its men to the Revolution. Admiral Andreas Miaoulis 
became the famous commander of the Greek fleet, while Georgios Koundouriotis was the 
first Prime Minister of the newly born Greek State from 1822 to 1827.

If you go to Hydra, you must visit the Museum of Hydra. Hydrian costumes, memories 
from the War of Independence, art objects of the 18th and 19th century, figureheads and 
paintings of the ships of the 1821 Greek Revolution are exhibited there.

Every year around June 20, a big festival is organised in Hydra called Miaoulia. A 
plane of the Greek Air Force drops a wreath into the sea in memory of the hero Andreas 
Miaoulis. It is good to communicate with history and remember that Miaoulis’ cross, and 
more importantly, his heart, the heart of Greece, is ‘alive’ in the Hall of Paintings of the 
Museum of Hydra even today.

1.   Hydra has always been a dry island with no forests. 
2.   Because agriculture was impossible, people started building ships.
3.   The island could offer a lot, and that’s why the Turks settled in the island.
4.   The Hydriots became important merchants by the 19th century.
5.    Hydriots  supplied  the  Turks  with  food  products.  They  had  the  monopoly  in  the 

   F

Mediterranean Sea.

6.   Hydriots were the first to start the Greek War of Independence.
7.   The Hydriot ships made up the whole Greek fleet.
8.   Admiral Andreas Miaoulis became the first Prime Minister of the New Greek State.
9.    You can find figureheads and paintings of the ships of the Greek Revolution in the 

Museum of Hydra.

10.  Nothing is left to see of Admiral Andreas Miaoulis today.

Task 2
Vana,  a  young,  Greek-American  girl,  who  spent  her  holidays  at  an  international 
campsite on Poros, took the photos below and wrote the following texts. Read the texts 
and underline the points that seem most important to you.

A) This is a panoramic view of the island of 
Poros,  one  of  the  most  picturesque  Greek 
islands in the Argosaronic Gulf near Athens. 
You  can  also  see  the  town  of  Galatas  on 
the  shore,  opposite  the  harbour  of  Poros. 
Frequent  water-taxis  and  small  boats  of 
all  kinds  going  back  and  forth  can  take  you 
there. It is only 300 metres to Galatas, where 
you can visit the beautiful lemon grove.

B) These are pictures of Poros 
harbour with the island’s white 
houses  going  from  the  water 
edge up the steep hill, of part 
of the waterfront, of boats in a 
calm  blue  summer  sea  and  of 
the best beach in Poros called 
‘Love Bay’.

Task 5
This is the letter one of the girls, Sandra, wrote to her friend Robert from Poros. For 
some reason it got mixed up. Think of how we write a letter, e.g. what we speak about 
first, what comes last. Put the parts of the letter below in order (1st, 2nd, …) after you 
have read it at least twice.

First, I took the bus from Athens to Nafplion. Then, I had to change and get another bus 
to Galatas. The road wasn’t in good condition, but the view was breathtaking. I haven’t 
seen such a beautiful blue sea before. Finally, I got off the bus and caught one of the 
boats across the Poros strait to Poros town. The people on the boat spoke Greek and I 
couldn’t understand a word, but they were helpful and friendly.

Here  I  am  on  the  island  of  Poros.  I  arrived  3  days  ago.  Since  then  I  have  been  busy 
meeting young people like myself from all over the world and seeing the sights on both 
sides of the Poros Channel. Getting here was an adventure that I quite liked.

Dear Robert,

Poros Island,
12 July 2004.

Here’s my address in case you wish to contact me. 
International Camp,
Poros Island,
Greece.

Take care.
Yours,
Sandra.

After  I  got  off  the  boat,  I  had  to  find  my  way  to  the  place  I  was  staying  at.  A  nice 
gentleman  said  I’d  better  take  a  taxi  because  my  place  was  on  the  other  side  of  the 
island. I got into a taxi and gave the address to the driver, who spoke a bit of English. 
The weather was warm. There was a pleasant smell of sea wind, flowers, lemon trees and 
food, all mixed up. I feel so relaxed. I’ll stay here for about 5 weeks.

C. Getting a beautiful tan

Task 1
Before you read the text, answer this question by ticking the right box.

Do you like relaxing in the sun in summer? 

Υes

Νo

Sometimes

See what happens while you are doing so.

As nothing feels quite as good as relaxing in the sun, one never thinks about the dangers 
of sunbathing. Sunlight is good for you because it helps you get rid of stress and helps 
your body produce vitamin D, which is very important for strong healthy bones. So, how 
can something so good as sunlight be so bad at the same time? Well, it is true that while 
you are relaxing in the sun to get a tan, there are three main dangers:

28/9/2022   1:19:45 µµ
28/9/2022   1:19:45 µµ

• burning
• ageing of your skin
• skin cancer

If you know about the dangers, then you can learn how to guard yourself against them.
Burning: If you wish to get a tan, you do not have to burn. When your skin starts getting 
red, this is a sign that your skin has been damaged. Sunburn is mainly caused by ultraviolet 
rays. You have to give your skin time to thicken and allow the cells of your skin time to 
produce melanin, which is the colour that gives your skin a tan.
Ageing: Doctors say that sunlight causes more changes in our skin than natural ageing 
does. They have shown that changes in the skin are due to sunlight rather than to the 
passing of time. This is because the ultraviolet rays break down our skin and make it dry 
and wrinkled.
Skin cancer: It is a fact that you can risk getting skin cancer if you stay too long in the 
sun. Too much sunlight is dangerous. If you try to tan faster than your skin can produce 
melanin, then the risk of skin cancer is bigger. You must be careful in the sun and keep 
an eye on changes to your skin.
How can you get a light tan with very little danger to your skin?
You  must  always  protect  your  skin  with  a  good  suntan  cream.  Look  for  the  sun 
protection factor number on the suntan cream. It tells you how much protection you 
will get from ultraviolet rays. The higher the number, the more protection you will get. 
A sun protection factor number 3 will let you stay out in the sun three times as long as 
you would usually stay without burning. A sun protection factor number 4 will let you 
stay out in the sun four times as long as you would usually stay without burning, and so 
on. Get the right sun protection factor and relax in the sun this summer without any risk!

Task 2
List the good and bad things about spending time in the sun.

Good things

Task 3

while notices and frequent announcements reminded passengers of what they should 
and should not do. In this way, Greek and foreign passengers remain safe and the 
metro is kept in good condition.

Of course, George could not remember all the metro announcements and notices. He 
wrote down some of them for Miss Anna. She asked for the help of Mr Spanos, the 
laboratory assistant. They recorded on tape what George reported.

Task 3
First,  form  groups  of  five.  Name  one  of  you  the  representative  of  the  group.  Then, 
divide a piece of paper in three columns. Call the first one "Passengers should", the 
second "Passengers should not" and the last "Passengers can".

Task 4

You  are  going  to  listen  to  the  tape  twice.  Try  to 
write at least two things that passengers should do 
(Column 1), should not do (Column 2) and can do 
(Column 3).

The History of the Telephone

On March 10 1876, in Boston, Massachusetts Alexander Graham Bell invented 
the telephone. His notebook entry of 10 March 1876 describes his successful experiment 
with the telephone. Speaking through the instrument to his assistant Thomas A. Watson, 
a young electrician, in the next room, Bell utters these famous first words: "Mr. Watson 
- come here - I want to see you".

‘Telephone’ comes from the Greek word ‘tele’, meaning ‘from afar’, and ‘phone’, 
meaning ‘voice’ or ‘voice sound’. Generally, a telephone is any device that conveys sound 
over a distance.

Man  has  always  wanted  to  communicate  from  afar.  People  have  used  smoke 
signals, mirrors, jungle drums, carrier pigeons and semaphore to get a message from one 
point to another. But a phone was something new. A real telephone could not be invented 
until the electrical age began. The electrical principles needed to build a telephone were 
known  in  1831,  but  it  wasn’t  until  1854  that  Bourseul  suggested  transmitting  speech 
electrically. It wasn’t until 22 years later, in 1876, that the idea became a reality.

Bell’s success with the telephone came as a direct result of his attempts to improve 
the  telegraph.  When  he  began  experimenting  with  electrical  signals,  the  telegraph 
had  been  an  established  means  of  communication  for  some  30  years,  but  with  its  
dot-and-dash Morse code, it was limited to receiving and sending one message at a time. 
Bell’s knowledge of the nature of sound and his understanding of music enabled him 
to think of the possibility of transmitting multiple messages over the same wire at the 
same time. Of course, he based his knowledge on the findings of other scientists and 
inventors. The telephone is a shared accomplishment among many pioneers, although it 
was Alexander Graham Bell who built a working transmitter with a membrane capable 
of varying electronic currents and a receiver that would reproduce these variations in 
audible frequencies.

Task 4 
Do you happen to know anything about the history of post? What is it? Does anyone 
in  class  know?  Does  the  phrase  ‘penny  black’  mean  anything  to  you?  You  must  be 
familiar with the name of Hermes from the Greek Mythology. Who was he? What was 
his job?

Write your answers here before you read on.

Hermes was the first ‘postman-god’. According to mythology, Hermes was said to be 
the Son of Zeus and Maia. Besides leading the dead people’s souls to Hades, Hermes 
brought luck, wealth, sleep and was the messenger of the gods living on Mount Olympus. 
Greek stamps in the past used to feature his head.

The invention of stamps is closely related to the invention of modern paper and to the 
Industrial  Revolution,  when  more  people  started  to  learn  how  to  read  and  write.  In 
earlier times, only the rich people and the rulers of countries sent messages with their 
servants, which were written on various materials such as the skin of a sheep and tablets 
made of clay. Papyrus (a kind of plant that mostly grows in the Nile Valley in Egypt) was 
used by the ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans.

Modern paper started being made in England by the 15th century. Horses and guides 
carried mail using the five main roads leading to London to and from different parts of 
the country. This mail service belonged to the State. It was His Majesty’s Mail. It goes 
without saying that if he wished to read a private citizen’s mail, he could do it easily.
The first mail coaches started being used in 1784. It must have been quite picturesque 
to watch them entering castle gates and see their uniformed guards blowing their horns. 
A number of years later, in 1840, the first stamp was issued. It was called the ‘penny 
black’,  it  cost  a  penny  and  the  person  who  designed  it  was  named  Sir  Rowland  Hill. 
Postcards were introduced by 1870. Post offices in the past offered services of all kinds 
of communication, not only of letter delivery.

Task 5
There are some mistakes in the statements below. Read the text again, correct them 
and rewrite them.

1. Hermes was the first Greek postman whose head was shown on a stamp.
2. The first stamp was invented in Greece by the gods on Mount Olympus.
3. The ancient Greeks wrote their letters only on clay tablets.
4. People started sending letters to each other during the Industrial Revolution.
5. Jet planes carried mail flying over the five main roads to London.
6. By the 15th century trains were carrying mail to every part of England.
7. Every rich citizen had his own private mail service.
8. The king of England was not allowed to read a private citizen’s mail.
9. One day in 1600 the king of England decided to introduce mail coaches.

Here is a recipe for making a Four Seasons pizza. Read on and match the pictures to 
what is said. Check the correct order with your partner and your teacher. You can find 
the details of the ingredients and toppings in the Appendices, Unit 4. 

 Rub the margarine or olive oil with your finger-tips 

into the flour until it looks like bread-crumbs.

 Take a large mixing bowl. Put the wholemeal flour in 
it. Mix the plain flour, the salt and the baking powder and 
sieve them into the bowl.

2

 Add enough milk to make all ingredients join up when 
you gather the mixture together with your hands. Try not 
to get it too sticky, but if it does, add some more flour. 
Roll the dough out into a circle and place it on a greased 
baking dish or baking sheet.

Task 2
Listen to the tape once again and try to fill in the instructions.

Instructions

First you need a medium-size shallow flan dish. Work on a flat surface rather than in 
a bowl. Sift 1 and a half teacups of ……… and a tablespoon (or teaspoon if you like) of 
sugar together. Rub 4 tablespoons of butter into the …………… with your finger-tips only. 
Make a wheel in this mixture and put in 1 tablespoon of cold water and only the yolk of 
the egg. Do not throw the egg white away. Mix everything and knead the …………… well 
into a round shape.

Now you are ready to move to the …………… stage. Roll out the dough lightly and evenly 
with short strokes going one way only into a circle a little …………… than your dish and 
about half a centimetre thick. Use very …………… flour for rolling out.

Grease the dish. Fold the pastry over the rolling-pin and gently ……… it over the dish. 
Line  the  bottom  surface  of  the  dish  carefully  making  sure  there  are  no  air  bubbles 
underneath. Reserve the rest of the pastry for the decorative shapes. ………… the apricot 
halves.  Spoon  a  circle  of  jam  around  the  edge  of  the  pastry  and  then  ………………  an 
inner circle of drained apricot halves. Fill in the dish with alternating circles of jam and 
apricots.

Re-roll the remaining pastry and cut …………… decorative shapes of your choice. The 
young TEE student who prepared this tart was thinking …… Christmas, and that’s why 
he cut out stars and holly leaves. Arrange your shapes on top of the tart …… the pattern 
of your choice.

Beat the egg white well in a bowl. Put in some caster sugar and a bit of water and brush 
lightly the surface of …… tart with this mixture. This is called “glazing”. You can sprinkle 
the surface with extra sugar if …… like. Bake for approximately 25 minutes at 200° C 
until …… becomes golden brown.

Task 3
Listen to the text again. Try to confirm what you have written and polish your work. If 
you wish, make a clear copy in class or at home.

Task 4
If  you  are  a  TEE  student  specialising  in  the  tourist  industry,  put  the  recipe  into 
practice.  Ask  teachers  and  students  from  other  classes  to  help.  Take  photographs, 
scan them in the computer room and make a poster exhibition. Serve the tart there 
with some refreshments.

D. The value of food and drink

Task 1
Read this information about Bill.
Do  you  remember  Bill,  the  boy  on  the  bicycle  who  asked  the  group  to  order  some  fresh 
orange juice for him? He is joining them now. Look at him.

Bill is an athlete besides being a TEE student. He cycles at least one hour a day. He is 
very careful with what he eats and drinks. He has never tried smoking.

What about you? Is food important for our health and well being at all stages of our 
life? Discuss with your partner.

Task 2
Read the text that follows and compare what you said about food with the information 
in it. What title would you give to the text? To help you understand this article, here 
are some words with their Greek translation.

nutrient=θρεπτικό συστατικό
maintain=διατηρώ
saturated fat=κεκορεσμένο λίπος
demand=απαιτώ
dairy products=γαλακτοκομικά προϊόντα
fibre=ίνα
emotional=συναισθηματικός
poultry=πουλερικά

Our body needs food in order to develop and live. Eating the right food can help our 
body  grow  naturally  and  normally.  This  is  why  we  should  try  to  make  sure  that  our 
diet is as full of nutrients as possible. More and more people are beginning to discover 
that certain kinds of food can be good for our body and can help it maintain its good

condition and fight illnesses, while other kinds of food are not good for it. Such food is 
called ‘junk food’, which is high in saturated fat and has a lot of sugar and salt.
All of us know that our nutritional needs vary a lot depending on our age, general life 
style and the demands the way we live places on our body. As a result, not everything 
suits everybody. Instead, we need to be aware of the products that are best for us and do 
good to our health.

Scientists and doctors say that beauty may result from a healthy diet, a lifestyle with no 
stress and regular exercise, which may also create a beauty within. The way our body 
looks reflects the state of our health and our emotional life.

What should our diet include to keep our body healthy? The good news is that we do 
not lack the information that tells us which food can cover our needs and be good for 
our health. Studies inform us that a healthy diet is one that provides the necessary water, 
fibre  and  nutrients  that  our  body  needs.  They  divide  food  into  five  big  categories  to 
which we can add a sixth one, which is not closely related to food. These are:
1. fruit and vegetables
2. carbohydrate foods
3. dairy products
4. meat, poultry, fish, beans, eggs and nuts
5. fatty and sugary foods and
6. water (and regular exercise)

Title       

Now compare your opinion on food to the article.

Task 3
You are going to listen to an experienced doctor giving more details on the variety of 
foods for each of the five food categories as well as for the sixth category, which is not 
closely related to the food mentioned above. Try to keep notes in your notebook. You 
will need them.

Task 4
List the categories of food mentioned after listening to the text for a second time. 

Healthy food

Junk food

Why do you think Bill uses the form I have
Tick the correct explanation below.

I have + past participle (called/prepared

called/prepared)?

a) Because he does not want to call his aunt and does not want to do his homework.
b)  Because  he  did  not have  time to call  his aunt and do  his homework up to the 

moment his mother asked him.

Task 5
Circle the sentence that describes the correct use of the Present Perfect Simple (I I + 
havehave + past participle of the verb).

The Present Perfect Simple
a) describes an action which usually happens as a matter of habit.
b) describes an action that is completed in the past at an exact time.
c) describes an action which is still incomplete up to now.

Task 6
The conversation between Bill and his parents continues. Fill in the missing parts of 
what they say. Use the Present Perfect Tense of the verbs in parentheses.

accident. (not - recover)

Mother:   Bill, Aunt Lucy …………………… your present yet. Is that all right? (not - buy)
Bill:  

It’s fine. Don’t worry, mum.

Task 7
Read  the  following  dialogue  and  notice  how  the  words  for  and  since  are  connected 
with the Present Perfect Tenses.

The Speaker’s Corner Game
a) Do you happen to know anything about Hyde Park and the Speaker’s Corner in London?

b)  Get  the  information 
from the Internet, write 
it  in  this  square  and 
talk  about  it  with  your 
classmates.

c) You are now ready to play the game that follows (pages 80-81). You only need a dice. 
Form groups of 4-5 persons. The aim of this game is for your group to reach the end 
point of the board first. One member of each group plays the ‘spy’. He becomes part of 
another group and sees that they don’t cheat. Each member of the group throws the dice 
once. The players have to perform the speaking tasks written in the squares they land 
on. Squares 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36 and 37 are the ones that can make your group fail to be 
the winners. If you land on one of them, you have to move back 4 spaces. If a player of a 
group cannot say something, the ‘spy’ moves the whole group back 4 spaces and another 
player continues the game.

1.  Do you think that even a Greek who doesn’t speak English uses them in his or her 

everyday Greek speech?

2.  If yes, why do you think this happens?

Task 3
Now read the text and answer the questions above.

If shopping in the past was just a matter of going to the grocer’s a few minutes away from 
home in the town square or to the local market place, shopping after the Second World 
War has dramatically changed.

As a child, I remember my mother sending me to the grocer’s with some eggs in a basket, 
potatoes in a sack or whatever else we had to exchange them for sugar, coffee, soap or 
other goods. The grocer knew my first name and my parents, he would ask me how I was 
doing in school and then take what I had brought for him and give me what my mother 
needed for home.

Then came the establishment of factories which produced everything one wanted and 
in big quantities. Variety and choice replaced the idea of managing with only what one 
could find in the local grocery, even if it was second best. Achieving and producing the 
best and the most and in the least possible time led to superman and superwoman and, 
eventually, to supermarkets, department stores and shopping centers.

The idea of buying ready-made food was unthinkable for the housewives of the forties 
and, even, fifties. They used to make the food provisions for their families themselves. 
Every home had a good vegetable garden too. They used to have their clothes and shoes 
made-to-measure and did not buy them ready-made.

Times change, and people do things they did not use to do. Even my mother, who in 
the past would never let us have the factory-made goods at home, eats corn flakes and 
chips together with her grand children and buys her cake at the supermarket. She hardly 
realises  that  shopping  has  expanded  to  the  point  that  her  Greek  includes  words  that 
a  person  from  any  of  the  25  member  states  of  the  EU  or  Singapore  would  not  only 
understand, but use them as well.

Task 4
Read the text above very carefully again and fill in the boxes below with the important 
stages in the development of shopping, in such a way that shows the contrast between 
then and now. There is some help for you.

Write your answers to questions 3, 4 and 5 below.

When it comes to the choice of presents, there is a strong possibility of choosing and 
buying  the  wrong  thing  for  the  wrong  person.  You  may  think  that  introducing  your 
children to computers at an early age is an excellent way of making learning fun and of 
broadening their world. Their response, however, may be: “But I wanted a doll and a 
wooden mouse, or a teddy bear and some marbles to play with!”

It is not surprising that parents, relatives or friends would want to continue the pleasure 
they had when they first read, for example, the story of the Little Red Riding Hood by 
introducing it to the children of their environment. The opening sentence “Once upon 
a time there was a little girl ...” can be easily remembered, immediately captivates the 
reader and is timeless. Who does not know the story of the little girl, her grandmother, 
the wolf and the hunter and wouldn’t want at moments of relaxation to hear a similar 
story?

You may also think it’s a good idea to surprise people with presents. Here is the story of 
a lady who received a present she did not want. “My husband is a great one for surprise 
presents. The worst time was when he told me that he had a present, which he had to 
give me on Christmas Eve. The present couldn’t wait till the next day. I became a bit 
suspicious. We were at a friend’s house. I told him that if it was a pet, I couldn’t find the 
time to look after it. My husband looked uneasy and said he was sure I’d love his present. 
Of course, it was a pet - a little kitten. I finally grew to love the animal, but I think it’s not 
a good idea to give pets as presents, unless you are sure they are wanted.”

Suppose  you  were  to  continue  the  article  on  presents.  Bring  another  example  and 
write a paragraph of no more than fifty words. Phrases and words like the following 
may be useful to you.

D. How language holds together and works

In this part of Unit 6, you will practise Grammar (how words relate to each other) 
and Syntax (in what order we put words next to each other) in order to be able to 
communicate. In this unit you will also practise English sounds (pronunciation).

“Used to ...” for habits in the past

Task 1
Study what the old lady says about shopping in the past:

•  I used to cook all the meals for my 

family myself.

• I did not use to buy ready-made food.

•  People  did  not  use  to  buy  their 

groceries at supermarkets.

•  We used to have vegetable gardens 
in the back yards of our homes.

Task 4
Underline the used to
used to sentences in the text on page 85. Then talk with your partner 
about  things  you  used  to  do  in  the  past,  but  you  do  not  do  any  longer.  Tell  your 
classmates in the back/front row about them.

Task 5
This lady has a totally different background from the lady in Task 1 and is not as old 
as she is, but she spent her life in the U.S.A. Now she is retired and she lives in Greece. 
Naturally, she misses her comfortable life in America, where everything is automatic 
and ready-made. This is what she says.
•  If I lived in America, I would order 

everything by phone.

•  If you wanted food from all over the 
world, shops would order it for you 
in America.

would not be enough to live the way 
I used to live in the past.

•  If  I  had  the  money,  I  would  buy  a 

luxury car.

•  If I knew how to cook, I would not ask 
you to help me with the pizza recipe.

sentences following the comma. Write the formula for this structure, which is called 
the Second Conditional in grammar. When do we use it? Is it possible for the lady to 
go back to America? Can she buy a luxury car now? She can dream, though, of what 
she could do if she were in America or if she had money.

Task 7
Fill in the table with the missing parts of the following sentences. Compare your work 
with your partner. Have you written the same sentences?

If you bought a luxury car,

If I could change my face,

If Mary thought badly about you,

she would buy a ticket.

they would send us an invitation.

I would not buy a lifejacket.

Task8
Look at the table on page 90 again (Articles 1 to 28). Ask your partner questions using 
both How many
How much bread?/
How many pyjamas? or How much pyjamas
How many pyjamas

How much pyjamas? Is the rule in the box below correct?

How much. Do we say How many bread

How many bread? or How much bread

How many and How much

We use How many with things (nouns) we can count. The nouns are countable and have 
a plural like eggs, potatoes, etc. We use How much with things (nouns) we cannot count 
at a glance. We need to weigh them. The nouns are uncountable and have no plural like 
milk, sugar, etc. Also, we cannot say a milk, a sugar, but we can say an egg, a potato.

Task 2
What do you know about art and graffiti? Read this text to get an idea.

What is the aim of a painting, a sculpture, a statue, a photograph, a work of art or a 
sketch, no matter how simple or primitive it is? Why should somebody take a piece of 
stone in his hand or use some colourful material and leave a mark?

It  seems  that  human  beings,  from  the  first  moment  on  this  earth,  felt  the  need  to 
communicate with each other and leave a tangible sign of their existence, first out of 
necessity  to  survive  and  later  on  because  they  needed  to  express  their  thoughts  and 
feelings and to look for beauty and aesthetic fulfilment.

The history of man on earth and the history of art go hand in hand. Works of art reflect 
the spirit of a period in history. They captivate the different aspects of human activity. 
Art  in  its  various  manifestations  in  turn  becomes  a  source  of  inspiration  for  future 
generations, shaping in a way their view of the world.

Take  for  example  “art  nouveau”,  a  style  of  design  which  developed  in  reaction  to 
industrialisation  around  1890-1910  and  was  characterised  by  asymmetry  and  exotic 
colouring. It certainly fed the imagination of artists then, but also became a forerunner 
of the later style developments in architecture and crafts and why not the developments 
of what today is called street art and graffiti. Before questioning whether graffiti is an 
art, we should not forget that graffiti (scribbles, messages, paintings) on walls of caves of 
prehistoric man is very valuable not only for its information, but as a sign of man’s need 
to express himself creatively and produce works of art.

Modern  graffiti  started  as  a  youth  culture  in  America,  but  by  now  young  persons  in 
Europe do graffiti paintings. Graffiti has influenced music, theatre, cartoons, posters, 
fashion designers and artists. It has taken many forms, and a growing number of young 
people are seriously interested in it. For them it is a means of expressing their feelings 
and opinions on current events and issues globally.

3.  Works of art reflect the period of history they are created in.
4.  Art in a way shapes a person’s view of the world.
5.  “Art nouveau” is about industrialisation in 1890-1910.
6.  “Art nouveau” played a role in the way art developed later on.

B. The portrait of an artist

Task 1
Go back to the previous section and look at picture number 4, page 101. Is the glass 
sculpture familiar to you? Do you know anything about the artist? What do you think 
this piece of art tries to express? Do you know how it is called? Does your partner 
know? Discuss with your classmates in the front/back row.

Task 2
Read the text to find out information about the artist and his work.

KOSTAS VAROTSOS
Artist – Professor at the School of Architecture, Aristotelio University, Thessaloniki

If I weren’t an artist, I would be a collector  – I like other people’s works. I know how 
difficult it is to create a good work of art. With a lot of my fellow artists’ works I feel that 
I’ve created them myself. I’ve bought a good number of them; some day I hope to build 
a house to put them in. I believe that contemporary art has been separated from what 
we call the social environment, hidden in museums that have become laboratories where 
specialists can carry out their scientific research. We all move around as one large family 
between museums and galleries. We’ve lost touch with the world. I understood very early 
on the importance of our relationship with the general public. It is an objective force 
vis-a-vis the art system, which is a virtual-artificial affair made of paper. I have attached 
a lot of importance to the relationship between art and the public, especially through 
my sculpture “Dromeas”. You always fear the criticism of your own people. It is harsher 
because it has neither a strategic nor a professional approach. The harsh criticism of 
the untrained eye can help you interpret a work of art. It is time we stopped analyzing 
everything.  Our  analytical  tendencies  are  actually  reducing  our  insight.  “Dromeas” 
signaled the change which came through synthesis rather than analysis.

Task 3
Read the text more carefully and answer the following questions (in your notebook).

1.  What is the aim of the writer of this article?
2.  Who is this information written for?
3.  Where do you think this short biography of the artist comes from?
4.  How does Varotsos feel about the work of his colleagues?
5.  How does he talk about his hope for the future?
6.  If Varotsos were not an artist, what would he be?
7.  What is Varotsos’ opinion on specialists?

C. Developing creativity

Task 1
Think of a toy that impressed you as a child and tell your partner. Why did it impress 
you? Why do you still remember it? Now read the following text (page 108) quickly to 
see what it is about.
Every parent would be interested to give his child the best toy possible:
•   To keep the child busy.
•   To occupy the child’s mind productively.
•   To develop its creative talents.
•   To have a lot of fun.

That’s why we have created our Get Started Set!
IT LOOKS LIKE A LOT OF FUN.
BUT IT’S A LOT CRAFTIER THAN THAT

Keeping little hands and young minds usefully busy is simpler than you can imagine with 
our Get Started Set which consists of two sets: a) the Clay Things Set and b) the Needle 
Arts Set.

With this box, children can discover and develop the pleasures of making models with 
clay. From first attempts to “works of art”, Get Started Clay Things Set has all that kids 
need:  Three  bags  of  special  clay,  paints,  varnish,  tools  for  cutting,  rolling,  decorating 
and patterning. There are sharper cutters too, and most importantly, a 40-page colour 
booklet by Barbara McKittrick. This tells the child what to do and what not to do (For 
example, How Not To Make A Mess).

Besides  developing  the  child’s  ability  to  use  his  hands  in  a  creative  way,  the  child  is 
having a lot of fun with Get Started Clay Things Set. This is the reason why your child 
will enjoy the set now and will understand its importance later on in life.

Besides  Get  Started  Clay  Things  Set,  there’s  Get  Started  Needle  Arts  Set  for  little 
embroiderers (needles, threads, tools for cutting and a thimble are included). This set 
could help tomorrow’s fashion designers develop the talent of adding that special touch 
to ordinary clothes.

If  our  Get  Started  Set  satisfies  you,  there’s  our  complete  candle-making  kit  Colour 
Candles Set. Call us. It will be sent to you upon request.

Task 2
Read the text again and answer these questions.
1. What kind of text is this? What features make it the kind of text it is?
2. Where can one find texts like this?
3. What is the aim of the writer of this text?
4. Who is the text addressed to?
5. If you were a parent, would you buy the sets? Why?/Why not?
6. Do you agree that the sets can fulfil what their manufacturers promise?

D. How language holds together and works

In this part of Unit 7, you will practise Grammar (how words relate to each other) 
and Syntax (in what order we put words next to each other) in order to be able to 
communicate. In this unit you will also practise English sounds (pronunciation).

Derivatives

Task 1
Read the following two groups of words and notice their common ending within each 
group.
English:  inspiration 
fulfilment 
Greek:  πραγματοποίηση 
ποίηση

ευαισθητοποίηση  ωραιοποίηση 

imagination  manifestation

generation 
development

industrialisation 

ικανοποίηση 

  Remember: We can form words by adding different kinds of endings e.g.

-ion-ion, -tion

-ment.
-tion, -ment

Add  the  above  endings  to  the  words  in  the  table.  Make  any  other  necessary  spelling 
changes. Some of the words take a different ending. Use a dictionary to check your work.

Now you may read the text.

Voula  Patoulidou  and  Pyrros  Dimas  are  very  special  Greek  people.  In  August  1992 
there was no Greek, young or old, who would not know their names and would not feel 
proud of them. This is the reason why.

It was the first time Greece had won two gold medals in an Olympiad. The athletes who won 
the medals were Voula Patoulidou and Pyrros Dimas. Voula was the winner of the women’s 
100-metre hurdles. Her gold medal was the first medal for Greece in athletics in 80 years. 
Pyrros, on the other hand, took the 82.5kg weightlifting event. Both of them said that nothing 
would stop them from competing in the future, and that they were proud to be Greeks.

Greek people gave the two Olympic gold medallists a heroes’ welcome after their return 
from Barcelona. Streets were lined with crowds of cheering spectators who were waving 
Greek flags and holding olive branches, as Voula and Pyrros went to the Panathenean 
Stadium. Each of them was crowned with a laurel wreath. A navy band played the national 
anthem, while eleven cannon shots were fired. The Greek Prime Minister congratulated 
the gold medallists too.

In the Olympic Games in ancient Olympia, winners did not receive any medals. They 
were only crowned with wreaths. Voula Patoulidou and Pyrros Dimas did not receive a 
gold medal only; the Onassis Foundation gave $50,000 to each of them.

The first Olympic Games began in ancient Olympia in 776BC, while the first modern 
Olympics began in Athens in 1896.

Task 3
Are the pictures above, the words in your spidergram and the information in the text 
related in a way? When you are ready to answer, discuss with your partner.

Task 4
The information below got mixed up. Can you put it right? Match the boxes as in the

Task 4
Carol  Russell  is  English,  but  she  works  for  an  English  company  selling  sports 
equipment in Athens. She also writes articles in sports news magazines. This is what 
she says about her favourite sport.

If spring makes you feel sportier, Athens offers quite a number of tennis facilities, and 
spring is the perfect time of the year to play tennis. Summer, apart from those who are 
fit enough or fanatical about the game, rules out play between 10 am and 7 pm.

For those of you who are interested in the sport, here are some of its attractions.

1.  Everyone can play tennis. No matter if you are a primary school kid, a middle-aged 
person  or  belong  to  the  category  defined  “elderly”,  you  can  practise  the  sport. 
Choose an opponent of your age range, otherwise you are offering yourself as an 
excellent target practice.

2.  There is no need to plan a game in advance, like for example you do for a football 
game. You wake up a fine spring morning, you round up a friend and there you are. 
Of course, mixed doubles can be interesting from many points of view.

3.  Tennis is not played inside a polluted city, but at a carefully chosen area where 
there is fresh air, trees, bushes and flowers. From a health point of view, tennis has 
this benefit.

4.  Tennis is superior to all other leisure activities because it combines skill and fitness, 
and you have to keep your mind active and use it when you are playing. Also, it is a 
polite face-to-face game and a trial of strength between two human beings.

Do we have to tell you more about the joys of the game?

If tennis is not your favourite sport, does what Carol says tempt you to start being 
interested in tennis? Discuss in class.

Task 5
Read the text again and write True (T) or False (F) next to the sentences.
1. The perfect time of the year to play tennis is summer between 10 am and 7 pm.
2. Not everyone can play tennis. You must be a school kid or an elderly person.
3. For a game of tennis choose an opponent who has the same age as you.
4. You do not have to make arrangements for a game of tennis in advance.
5. The game is more interesting if the opponents are boys and girls.
6. Tennis can be played inside a city, and this is good from a health point of view.
7. Tennis is just like any other leisure activity, you just hit a ball with a racket.
8. A game of tennis is a face-to-face trial of strength between two people.

Task 6

C. Let’s keep active and healthy!

Task 1
Discuss in groups or in class.

• Why should we be active and exercise our muscles?
• How much of the body weight is made up of bones and fat?
• What happens to our muscles if we don’t use them?

Task 2
Pat  Kingsley,  a  former  Physical  Education  teacher,  is  now  in  charge  of  a  group  of 
water polo players who are training for the future Olympic Games in China. This is 
what she says about physical fitness. Read the text and match each of the titles below 
to the paragraphs (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th).

If you do not use your body and do not train your muscles, then you are wasting 
it.  It  is  not  enough  to  use  your  body  to  do  normal  daily  tasks.  You  need  more 
physical activity to keep your body in good condition and increase its strength and 
endurance. This is the reason why.

You may not know how your body works, so try to think of a machine. What does 
a machine need in order to work? Fuel. Now, in order for a machine to produce 
energy, fuel is burned, and the various pipes and cables of the machine’s system 
carry the energy produced to where it is needed for consumption.

The human body works just like a machine. We all know that the human body is 
made of bones, muscles and fat. There are about 600 or more types of muscles, 
which form about 40 per cent of our body weight. These muscles produce force, 
store energy, can shorten and stretch and that’s how we walk, breathe, eat and stay 
alive. The fuel that makes muscles work and keeps them healthy is blood, which is 
carried to the muscles by our blood vessels. Muscles must be continually supplied 
by blood, otherwise they cannot work and develop.

Your body’s  strength and efficiency depend on how well your  muscles  are used 
and developed. That is why you need regular exercise, because exercise trains your 
muscles and develops their physical capacity to a high degree. The more exercised 
and trained your muscles are, the more fit and efficient your body is.

Paragraph

A Bodies and machines work in the same way.

B Blood makes muscles work and develop.

C Regular exercise trains and strengthens our body muscles.

D Normal daily activity is not enough for our body’s health.

D. How language holds together and works

In this part of Unit 8, you will practise Grammar (how words relate to each other) 
and Syntax (in what order we put words next to each other) in order to be able to 
communicate. In this unit you will also practise English sounds (pronunciation).

The Passive Voice

Task 1
Look at these sentences from the text on page 120.

• Streets were lined with crowds of cheering spectators.
• Eleven cannon shots were fired.
• They were crowned with wreaths.

Now tick the right answer to the following questions.

Do we know the names of the spectators?

Do we know who fired the cannons?

Do we know the names of the athletes in ancient Greece who were 
crowned?

Is it important that we should know?

Now read the information in the box to learn more.

YES NO

When we are more interested in the actions than in the person who did them, 
or the people who did the actions are too many or anonymous, then we use what 
we call in grammar Passive voice
Passive voice. It is formed with the verb ‘bebe’ in the right tense 
and the past participle of the verb of the active sentence. For regular verbs the 
past participle ends in -d-d/-ed-ed. The irregular verbs have their own past participle.

Here are a few more sentences in the passive voice from the text on page 125:

• Fuel is burned.
• Blood is carried.
• The energy is needed.

a)  Use  the  tenses  indicated  in  the  table  below  to  fill  in  the  gaps  in  the  incomplete 
sentences. We did the first for you.

Tense

Present Tense

Past Tense

Future Tense

Sentence

Streets          are lined          with crowds of spectators.

Streets ................................ with crowds of spectators.

Streets ................................ with crowds of spectators.

Present perfect Tense

Streets ................................ with crowds of spectators.

Past perfect Tense

Streets ................................ with crowds of spectators.

b) Discuss in class how meaning is affected in each sentence by using the passive tenses.

Task 3
If you have forgotten how to form the Past Perfect Tense and when we use it, read the 
following short text.

Gabriella, an excellent tennis player, was beaten by her opponent, Chris. This is what 
Gabriella says: “I made many mistakes. I had not expected that she would take advantage 
of them. Someone I had dominated for years beat me. I had won 11 matches played with 
her. Actually, before having this problem with my leg muscles, I had had a broken thumb 
that needed surgery”.

Which of the two actions in the grid happened first? Write 1 for the first past action 
and 2 for the more recent one.

Chris’ victory

Gabriella’s loss

Chris’ victory

Gabriella’s 11 victories

Gabriella’s 11 victories

Gabriella’s problem with the thumb

Grammar Rule: The Past Perfect Tense is used to refer to an action that took place in 
the past before another action.

Task 4
Put the verbs in parentheses in the correct tense (Simple Past or Past Perfect Simple).
1.  I realised I ............................ my money at home when I ............................ on the bus. 

(leave-get)

2.  When I ................................. home, I ................................. where I .................................

The article that follows is related to what are internationally called “green issues.” Do 
you know what this means? Is the poster of Artemida related to them? Read on to find 
out. Then give the article a title.

There is one issue that cannot leave people indifferent: the threat to our environment. 
Air and water are all contaminated by the discharges of modern society.

This is how Mr. John Nikolakis felt when he returned to Greece to settle down with his 
Greek-American family in Athens. Mr. Nikolakis went to America in 1970.

“We  find  Greece  unbelievably  dirty  and  polluted.  The  water  is  not  clean,  seas  and 
waterways are not fit to swim in. My family finds this unacceptable after being used to 
the outdoor life in America. Returning to Greece after staying in the USA for all these 
years, our first impression of Athens is of a polluted, dirty, litter-strewn city, with a bad 
sewage disposal system. The government should do something and stop being blind and 
deaf to the pollution they are allowing.”

“My wife and I came to Greece,” Mr. Nikolakis continues, “to see if we could bring up 
our children as Greeks, but my answer is a definite no. It makes us sad, particularly me, 
since I am Greek, to see how the country has deteriorated. Our children have a better 
future in the USA, where the average American cares about the country and is willing

to speak out to keep his country clean. Greece is only just introducing lead-free petrol, 
which was available in the States years ago. Food additives, which are totally banned in 
the USA, are still used here. Why is Greece so behind on these important issues? Worst 
of all is the attitude of the people – it seems they are totally uninterested.”

WHO DOES THE EARTH

BELONG TO?

Task 1
Read the text with the above question in mind. Have animals been created in order to 
serve humans? Then discuss in class. 

Cruelty to Animals Used in Experiments
Lynn Powell, Reports

Earlier  this  week  neighbours  close  to 
an  Athenian  hospital  alerted  the  police 
and animal welfare organisations because 
they could hear dogs howling in pain on 
the roof of the hospital.

The  police  searched  the  hospital  and 
discovered  that,  although  the  hospital 
doctors had no permit to do experiments 
on animals, the operating room was filthy, 
while dogs, rats and other small animals 
were  trapped  in  tiny  cages.  The  animals 
were  forced  to  suffer  extremely  painful 
deaths in barbaric conditions.

Professor  Nick  Petrou,  Director  of  the 
hospital’s University Clinic, and the rest of 
the officials explained that the research was 
for the benefit of everybody and mankind 
in general. In response to the protest that 
followed  in  the  mass  media,  Professor 
Petrou said: “Without laboratory animals, 
science  cannot  go  forward.  International 
practice  too  confirms  that  research  is 
necessary for scientific progress.”

Linda  Newman,  spokeswoman  for  the 
Animal Welfare Society in Athens, a pro-

fessor in medicine herself, has a different 
opinion on the use of animals for medical 
experiments.

“British,  French,  Italian  and  German 
specialists,”  she  said,  “have  found  out 
first that animals differ organically from 
humans, a fact that makes the experiments 
useless.  Also,  there  are  other  methods 
which international scientists propose to 
researchers”  she  went  on  to  say,  “which 
do not require the sacrifice of the lives of 
thousands of animals.”

“Video,  for  example,  could  be  used 
world-wide  to  reproduce  the  results  of 
experiments  carried  out  by  medical  and 
veterinary  students  instead  of  killing  all 
these  animals.  Computers  and  audio 
visual  systems,  together  with  a  variety 
of  methods  of  chemical  analysis,  could 
reduce the need to kill animals.”

Professor Newman concluded by saying 
that the hospital should not have ignored 
health regulations, and that they plan to 
press legal charges against the doctors of 
the hospital.

C. Natural resources: Use with care!

Is  the  picture  below  familiar  to  you?  Actually,  every  Greek  home  receives  this 
envelope  every  three  months.  It  comes  from  the  Water  Sewerage  Company  and 
informs consumers about the price they will have to pay for its services.

Task 1
Think about the questions below before you read the information that follows and find 
out how your classmates feel about water.

1. Do you agree with the slogan on the ΕΥΔΑΠ envelope?
2. Just how much water do you use per day?
3.  Do you leave the tap running when you brush your teeth and when you wash your 

hands?

4. What do you know about water?

Task 2
Read this information to find more about water consumption.

 Use Water Wisely 
One of the most important of the earth’s resources is water. Water is the source of life as 
we rely on it. Apart from the necessary quantity of water humans need to replace their 
body fluid, they need water in their homes for home appliances, for the housework, for 
their  waste  water  systems  and  for  their  domestic  animals,  as  well  as  for  industry  and 
agriculture.

While 72% of the earth’s surface is covered with water, not all this water can be drunk. 
Most of it is salt water. We must realise that whatever chemicals we use and throw in the 
drain, from washing powder to cooking oil, we affect the water. The average household 
nowadays uses 75% more water than 40 years ago. Another waste of water comes from

pipes that burst and from leaking pipes. Recent hot and dry summers warn us that the 
earth water supply is not going to last for ever.

There are several ways for all of us to help save water and stop wasting it.
• Don’t leave the tap running carelessly when you wash your hands.
• Also, don’t leave the tap running when you brush your teeth.
•  A leaking tap can lose about half a kilo of water every quarter of an hour, so make 

an effort to repair it promptly.

• Try not to be wasteful when you are flushing the toilet.
• Use washing machines and dishwashers for full loads.
• During summer water your plants and garden in the evening.
• If possible, collect rainwater and use it in your household, but not for drinking.
•  Take showers instead of baths. Baths use three times more water than showers.

Task 3
Match the explanations with the relevant words/phrases as in the example.

1.  resources               =>  sources of useful supplies, like oil
2.  body fluids 
3.  appliances 
4.  domestic animals 
5.  drain 
6.  affect 
7.  leaking pipes 
8.  promptly 
9.  household 
10. flush the toilet 

pipes that have cracks or holes in them

liquids in our body, as doctors call them 
everything connected with a house
press a handle to fill the toilet bowl with water
machines we do things with at home
pets/farm animals that are not wild any longer

a pipe that carries away water or sewage

Task 4
Using part of the ways to save water in Task 2, prepare a short questionnaire to find 
out the water habits of a person you know, a villager, an old person and a city person. 
Compare your results with those of your classmates.

Task 2
A piece of writing develops on a main idea. Read on carefully, find the main idea and 
make it the title of this report.

Title

People from Japan to Greece, Moscow to San Francisco, Mexico City to Kuwait are aware 
there is a serious environmental threat. Climate change, global warming, destruction of 
forests, acid rain, air, water and land pollution are too obvious to ignore. Besides, the 
statistics speak for themselves. Half of the world population lives in urban environments 
adding to waste problems with which the world’s cities are already struggling hard.

As the environmental problems continue to grow, there is a public demand globally that 
the world community should pull together and take action. If people from all walks of life 
take action, the role that they can play in protecting their environment can be critical.

Supported  by  the  United  Nations  Environment  Program,  a  group  of  young  people  has 
decided to do something positive about the pollution they saw when travelling around the 
world. They became aware of the global litter problem on land and in the seas. After returning 
home one Sunday morning, they put on gloves, picked up a bag and got out there to make 
their neighbourhood and the beach near it a healthier and more attractive place to live in.

The group who call themselves the “Clean-up Brigade” managed to inspire adults to 
organise  a  clean-up  expedition.  Groups  from  other  neighbourhoods  imitated  them, 
and  after  gathering  a  committee  of  friends  and  supporters,  they  found  sponsors  and 
expanded their activities. The clean-up campaign eventually involved 1000 people and 
was the biggest garbage collection ever. The bags of garbage in front of their eyes are 
witness to the long hours the clean-up business demands.

Task 3
Read the text again. Then find a subtitle for each paragraph, write it in the relevant 
box and underline the cue words or phrases that led you to it.

Task 4
A spokesperson of the group is visiting your school. What questions would you ask 
him or her? The first is asked for you.
1. How can we contact the “Clean-up Brigade” group?

Task 5
You have been chosen, without notice, to welcome the spokesperson and give a short 
speech. Don’t panic! The model phrases below can help you in many ways, e.g. they 
can  give  you  time  to  think,  organise  what  you  are  going  to  say,  work  out  answers, 
prepare some quick notes in your notebook. Use these phrases and act out in class.

• Well, let me think about it … 
• Let me see … 
• Umm/Er, I’m not really … sure … 
• Just a minute, I’ll check it in …
• I really cannot tell you …

• Let me look at my notes …
• Now, let me see …
• Er, I’m not quite certain …

Task 6
Listen to a conversation between two people. Then explain

a) who these people are.
b) what the topic of their conversation is.
c) how they feel about each other.
a) ...........................................................................................................................................
b) ...........................................................................................................................................
c) ...........................................................................................................................................

E. How language holds together and works

In this part of Unit 9, you will practise Grammar (how words relate to each other) 
and Syntax (in what order we put words next to each other) in order to be able to 
communicate. In this unit you will also practise English sounds (pronunciation).

A brief note on grammar

Task 1
Before  you  go  to  task  2,  look  at  the  verbs  listed  in  column  1.  They  are  irregular. 
Complete the missing Past Tenses in column 2. If you don’t remember them, ask your 
classmate, your teacher or get help from your dictionary.

Task 2
Study this sentence about Nick (the boy on page 7, Chapter 1):
Nick was planning to attend Senior High School when his Uncle Bill offered him a job 
on his farm.
Notice the form of the verb planplan in the first part and the form of the verb offer
offer in the 
second. They are different. This is because the duration of the action in each part of 
the sentence is not the same and because we talk about different kinds of actions in 
each part of the sentence. While Nick was doing something else for some time, another 
sudden event (his uncle’s offer) stopped him from what he was doing.

We  use  the  Past  Continuous 
(was,  were+verb  ending  in  -ing) 
for an action that was in progress 
in  the  past  and  the  Simple  Past 
(verb ending in -ed or irregular 
simple past form) for the action 
that stopped and/or interrupted 
what was happening.

Task 3
Fill in the incomplete sentences below with the verb that matches the meaning of the 
sentence in the correct tense (Simple Past or Past Continuous).

leave, see, have, get down, get on, meet, break, go, knock, realise, rain, sing,

One way ideas are connected together is by cause and effect. If we ask why Mr. 
Nikolakis felt unhappy after his arrival in Greece, we want to know the cause of his 
problem. If we want to know whether he eventually stayed in Greece, we want to 
know the effect. This is how we join the ideas.
a)  Mr. Nikolakis felt unhappy in Greece.
b)  He returned to the USA
=>  Because Mr. Nikolakis felt unhappy, he returned to the USA.

As Mr. Nikolakis felt unhappy, he returned to the USA.
Note: Don’t forget to put a comma before the main clause.

Task 4
Join the sentences below using any of the two cause-and-effect links.
1. Mr. Nikolakis forgot his life in Greece. He returned to the USA. 
2. ...............................................................................................................................................
3. Americans care about their country. They keep it clean. 
4. ...............................................................................................................................................
5. Greek people are friendly. Athens is visited by many tourists. 
6. ...............................................................................................................................................

Ideas are connected by using other linking words too. This is how we do it.

  Mr. Nikolakis felt unhappy. He stayed in Greece.
=>   Mr. Nikolakis felt unhappy, but he stayed in Greece.
  Although Mr. Nikolakis felt unhappy, he stayed in Greece.

Note:  Don’t forget to put a comma where you should, i.e. before but and after the 

sentence starting with Although.

Task 6

We know certain facts about Mr. Nikolakis. These facts cannot change. We could 
talk, however, about them as if we could change them. This is, of course, impossible. 
This is how we talk about the impossible.

Mr. Nikolakis left Greece in 1970. He did not see some developments there.
If Mr. Nikolakis had not left Greece, he would have seen some developments there.
This structure is called 3rd Conditional in grammar.

If + Past Perfect

would +  past infinitive 

(have + past participle)

Past Perfect  =>  would

Join these sentences by using ifif  + Past Perfect  =>

The Speaker’s Corner Game
a)  See  if  you  can  find  any  pictures  of  Hyde  Park  and/or  the  Speaker’s  Comer  in  the 
Internet. Stick them here.

b) You are now ready to play the game that follows (pages 161-162). You only need a 
dice. Form groups of 4-5 persons. The aim of this game is for your group to reach the 
end point of the board first. One member of each group plays the “spy”. He becomes 
part of another group and sees that they don’t cheat. Each member of the group throws 
the dice once. The players have to perform the speaking tasks written in the squares 
they land on. Squares 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36 and 37 are the ones that can make your group 
fail to be the winners. If you land on one of them, you have to move back 4 spaces. If a 
player of a group cannot say something, the spy moves the whole group back 4 spaces 
and another player continues the game.

Task 8
Fill  in  the  prepositions  that  accompany  the  verbs.  The  sentences  come  from  the 
previous chapters.

1.  We exchanged whatever we had .......... sugar, coffee, soap or other goods.

Unit 1

Here are the psychologist’s suggestions:
Here are the psychologist’s suggestions:

1.  The most critical issue is to increase your child’s view of himself or herself.

2.  Be sure to let your child assume responsibility for his or her next step. Let him or her 

know that deciding which school he or she should attend is up to him or her. You are 

not punishing your child by forcing the choice of a TEE.

3.  Tell your child that perhaps it will be a mistake to be at a school which is wrong for 

what  he  or  she  really  wants  to  do  in  his  or  her  life.  If  Senior  High  School  is  more 

stressful, it’s better to choose a school which could be easier.

4.  Provide  a  world  of  support  for  the  child.  A  teenager  may  take  a  bad  report  as  a 

personal  failure.  To  help  the  child  not  reach  this  damaging  conclusion,  encourage 

everyone in his or her world, like relatives and friends, to let him or her know that he 

or she is not inadequate in any way, and that not choosing a Senior High School is not 

something to be ashamed of.

5.  Create daily successes for your child. Ideally, a TEE school allows for 3 years of what 

one might call growing towards your profession. Make comparisons with children of 

your environment who became successful professionals because they had graduated 

from a TEE. Tell your child how smart he or she is to make a move towards making 

money earlier than other graduates and getting ahead by securing a job for himself or 

herself.

I worry? Show signs of life. Bye, Nicky.

4.  Lucy, this is Betty. I’ve just come back from my weekend at my home village. I’m going

terrible mess. At first, I thought I had a break-in. Then, I realised I had forgotten to 
close the kitchen window (yes, the one you always remind me of), I hadn’t checked 
whether I had locked the balcony door, I hadn’t put the garbage out, I hadn’t thought 
the weather would turn so bad, I hadn’t … Oh, please, do something! Call me back at 
once …!

5.  Hi,  Lucy!  Jason  here.  Listen.  Something  must  be  wrong  with  Rudolph.  He  keeps 
scratching all the time and looks miserable. Do you think he’s got cat fleas? Shall I 
call the vet? Cheers!

First you need a medium-size shallow flan dish. Work on a flat surface rather than in 
a bowl. Sift 1 and a half teacups of flour and 1 tablespoon (or teaspoon if you like) of 
sugar together. Rub 4 tablespoons of butter into the mixture with your finger-tips only. 
Make a wheel in this mixture and put in 1 tablespoon of cold water and only the yolk of 
the egg. Do not throw the egg white away. Mix everything and knead the dough well into 
a round shape.

Now you are ready to move to the second stage. Roll out the dough lightly and evenly 
with short strokes going one way only into a circle a little larger than your dish and about 
half a centimeter thick. Use very little flour for rolling out.

Grease the dish. Fold the pastry over the rolling-pin and gently lift it over the dish. Line 
the bottom surface of the dish carefully making sure there are no air bubbles underneath. 
Reserve the rest of the pastry for the decorative shapes. Drain the apricot halves. Spoon 
a circle of jam around the edge of the pastry and then make an inner circle of drained 
apricot halves. Fill in the dish with alternating circles of jam and apricots.

Re-roll the remaining pastry and cut out decorative shapes of your choice. The young 
TEE student who prepared this tart was thinking of Christmas, and that is why he cut 
out stars and holly leaves. Arrange your shapes on top of the tart in the pattern of your 
choice.

Beat  the  egg  white  well  in  a  bowl.  Put  in  some  caster  sugar  and  a  bit  of  water  and 
brush lightly the surface of your tart with this mixture. This is called “glazing”. You can 
sprinkle the surface with extra sugar if you like. Bake for approximately 25 minutes at 
200° C until it becomes golden brown.

Enjoy it!

An experienced doctor gives more details on the variety of foods for each of the five 
food  categories  already  mentioned  as  well  as  the  sixth  category  related  to  water, 
exercise and emotions.

 Group 1.  Fruit and vegetables. Make sure you include five portions a day. At least one 
third of our food should come from this group. It does not matter if they are frozen or 
fresh. They are important sources of vitamins, minerals, dietary fibre and phytochemicals, 
which protect our health.

 Group 2.  Carbohydrate foods. Also, one third of our food should come from this group. 
Cereals (especially wholegrain), bread (mainly wholemeal) and potatoes are included in 
this group. This group is low in fat and high in magnesium and vitamin B.

 Group 3.  Dairy products. As there is a large variety of these products (milk, cheese and 
butter are some of them), you must choose the low fat varieties. This group contains 
calcium, high-quality protein, vitamins A and D and B complex vitamins.

 Group 4.  Meat, poultry, fish, beans, eggs and nuts. Choose the varieties that are low 
in  fat,  and  don’t  eat  large  amounts  of  this  group.  This  group  contains  protein,  iron, 
magnesium, zinc and vitamin B, which are necessary in our diet.

 Group 5.  Fatty and sugary foods. Oils, sweets, cakes, biscuits, ice-creams and chocolate 
belong to this group. Although they are tasty and high in calories, they are low in vitamins 
and other nutrients. Therefore, we shouldn’t eat them often.

 Group 6.  Make certain you drink large quantities of water because our body cannot live 
without it. Don’t forget to take regular exercise; go for walks, jog or swim almost daily. 
Don’t neglect your emotional ‘food’ too. When you feel unhappy and frustrated, food is 
not processed properly and cannot fully benefit our body.

Unit 6

Welcome to our department store. We’ll be more than happy to serve you and make 
your shopping pleasant and comfortable. Ask for any item you wish, and if we don’t have 
it in stock we’ll order it for you and send it to your home.

Now,  if  you  are  an  interested  parent  and  you  want  to  buy  educational  fairy-tales  for 
your children, you can find a wide selection in the basement, where you can sit in our 
comfortable armchairs and make your choice at your own leisure. The children’s fashions 
section is there too, so you can have a look as well.

If you are in a hurry to meet a friend, or you wish to have a business lunch, don’t worry. 
You can do it all in one place without wasting time. Our restaurant on the top floor, with 
a beautiful view of the river, is a quiet place to relax, enjoy a meal and discuss business 
at the same time.

In the meantime, your wife or companion can spend her time in our Hair and Beauty 
Salon and try a new hair-do on the fifth floor. She can join you later on and you can 
go together to buy the new suitcase for your trip to France. The Handbags, Belts and 
Luggage section is on the 2nd floor. If you feel like buying a bottle of perfume for her or 
a bracelet, you can pop in the Cosmetics and Perfumery sections or the jewellery, which 
are next to the Lingerie and Hosiery sections, all on the 3rd floor.

If you still have time, then you can look on the 4th floor for that cordless screwdriver you 
want so much, which tightens loose handles, puts together toys and furniture and makes 
quick repairs all over the house. Menswear and the shoe studio are there too. The right 
wing of the 1st floor is entirely left to women’s wear. Bedlinen, towels and quilts are there 
too. The Stationery and Haberdashery sections are on the left wing of the same floor.

Have a nice day and thank you for your attention!

Graffiti artist:  

 Here we are. I wanted to show you one of the graffiti that my friends 
and I did. It’s a mural. We covered the wall during the night. We used 
aerosol paint. There, down there we scribbled our signatures. What do 
you think?

Interviewer:   Well, I’m trying to understand it. Why did you do it?
Graffiti artist:  

 Man,  that’s  a  long  answer!  You  start  doing  graffiti  when  you  have  a 
lot to prove. There is a certain beauty about expressing your emotions, 
when you protest you play your share in civil disobedience.
I see your point of view.
 Today’s teenage generation is now the biggest the world has ever seen. 
You can contact them via mobiles, the Internet …
Do you mean you want to share your thoughts and feelings with them? 
 Yes. Graffiti can be great! When your call is answered, you feel satisfied, 
that moment no matter how short it is, untangles everything.

Interviewer:  
Graffiti artist:  

Interviewer:  
Graffiti artist:  

Interviewer:   Who taught you how to do graffiti?
Graffiti artist:  

 My cousin Andrew was my first teacher. He gave me my first spray and 
taught me how to paint, everything about colour, how to have fun. I can 
also draw.
 That’s  right.  You’ve  got  a  point  there.  But  what  about  mindless 
vandalism, smoking, drinking, doing drugs?
 I live my life and this mural is a beautiful collaboration I’m very proud 
of. But, put it in your interview man, I’m not going to preach to anybody 
how to live their life. Listen, I decided to never get out of control and 
never did. Graffiti is wonderful. It’s now expanding. Here, look at our 
poster for the International Art Competition in 1998, there is a canvas 
category, murals, a pen and ink category, and other medium categories.
Thank you very much. I think I understand more about graffiti now.

Sports of the Olympic Games

The  history  of  this  sport  can  be  traced  back  to  thousands  of  years  ago.  Indians  and 
Polynesian  islanders  of  the  Pacific  used  canoes  to  fish,  hunt  and  travel.  The  Eskimo 
version is the kayak. Eskimos introduced the kayak many years ago. The canoe/kayak 
sport is included in the Olympic games.

For  this  sport  you  need  strong  hands  and  shoulders  and  flexible  muscles.  It  is  an 
endurance test that finishes at a speed of up to 10 metres a second. Rowing crews cover 
the middle 1000 metres at about 40 strokes per minute.

For this sport you need a recurve bow coated in fibreglass and arrows made of aluminium 
and  carbon  graphite  which  can  travel  more  than  240  km/h.  You  need  steady  hands, 
strong shoulders, flexible muscles, sharp eyes and nerves of steel. Robin Hood has had 
all these, since archery dates back to medieval times.

This sport features 3 exciting disciplines: road, track and mountain biking. Bicycles were 
developed in the mid-18th century as a form of transport. Bicycle races have been held 
for a long time (since 1896). Cycling is an interesting and entertaining sport.

A:  We were hoping that you would make the announcement soon, as you promised.
B:  You are quite right, but the Interior Minister was called away.
A:  You are not trying to tell me that work stops at the Ministry until he returns.
B:  Well, what I mean is …
A:   Now, if by August 15 there is no announcement for the new landfill site, we warn you 

that the municipality of Tiverton will close the dump down.

B:   It appears to me that you are making a hasty decision.
A:  We’ve been waiting for a long time.
B:   It’s true, but you must realise that the co-operation of all the bodies involved – the 

Ministry of National Economy, Health and Agriculture – is necessary.

A:  Yes, but …
B:    Besides, we must avoid any possible risks. Public health will be threatened by such a 

move. You should not forget it is in summer.

A:  Are you saying that the people of Tiverton are not part of the public?
B:   They certainly are, but we’re viewing the matter in a wider sense.
A:   We  would  like,  however,  to  make  it  clear  that  if  the  government  does  not  make 
the announcement, the dump will be closed down as a warning from August 18 to 
August 20. There will be a further closure from August 27 to 30. From then onwards, 
we will not operate the landfill at all. Would you like it in writing?

B:  I don’t think it’s necessary. I’ll pass on your message. Thank you.
A:  You are welcome.
